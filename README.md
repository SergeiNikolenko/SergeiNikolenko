## Education üéì

**Higher Education**: D. Mendeleev University of Chemical Technology of Russia, 2018‚Äì2023.
- Faculty of Fundamental and Applied Chemistry
- Profile: Medicinal Chemistry, diploma with teaching rights
- Average grade: 83

## Work Experience üíº

**Internship at In Silico**, ongoing.  
During my internship at In Silico medicine, I gain experience in the Chemistry42 department. My supervisor helps me explore Medicinal and Computational Chemistry and informs me about current topics and trends in this field.

## Research Activities üî¨

1. **Molecular Medicine Laboratory, FNKC FHM**  
Participated in molecular medicine research, DNA isolation, and qRT-PCR for gene expression analysis.

2. **Skoltech Laboratory of Industry-oriented Materials Search**  
Conducted research in the calculation of structure and properties of molecular co-crystals. I used calculation packages like QE, LAMMP, the USPEX algorithm, and visualized and processed data using matplotlib and VESTA tools. I also wrote scripts using DeepMD and ACE tools, and worked on a cluster.

3. **Structural Bioinformatics Laboratory, V.N. Orekhovich Institute of Biomedical Chemistry**  
I am currently researching estradiol binding to the estrogen receptor as a potential carrier of target groups using molecular docking and molecular dynamics methods for my specialist degree in Medicinal Chemistry. I use tools such as AutodockVina, Smina, VinaGPU, Gromacs, MMGBSA, and Prolif.
